# Cursor-movement-on-object-motion
This project is a mouse simulation system which performs all the functions performed by your mouse corresponding to your hand movements and gestures. System will detect hand which will act as cursor. 
In this, the camera captures your video and depending on your hand gestures, you can move the cursor and perform left click, right click, drag, select and scroll up and down.
The predefined gestures make use of only two fingers marked numerically. The project is essentially a program which applies image processing, retrieves necessary data and implements it to the mouse interface of the computer according to predefined notions. 
The code is written on Python. It uses of the cross-platform image processing module OpenCV and implements the mouse actions using Python specific library PyAutoGUI. 
The system can be broken down in three main components, which are - Hand Tracking, Gesture Recognition, Cursor Control.
The project can be useful for various professional and non-professional presentations. It can also be used at home by users for recreational purposes like while watching movies or playing games.

To develop this project we will be using two functionalities like:
1. Movement of cursor triggered by the hand movement.
2. Click will be triggered based on the action of Index finger and Middle finger.
